# Heat Pump Contribution Analysis – Insights Report

## Overview

This report presents key insights from the analysis of real-world energy data, focusing on evaluating the contribution of heat pump energy consumption at various facility locations. I have processed data from heat pump energy meters, iSolar Cloud total consumption, and location mapping files. The analysis assesses the share of energy used by heat pumps relative to overall facility energy usage at different time resolutions (hourly, daily, monthly).

## Key Findings

**Distinct Consumption Patterns**

Temporal Trends:

* At the hourly level, energy consumption displays significant fluctuations, typically peaking during mid-day hours and dipping during early morning or late-night hours.

* On a daily basis, averaged consumption reveals smoother trends, yet there is a recurring pattern where heat pump usage increases on colder days.

* Monthly aggregations show clear seasonal trends. In winter months, the contribution of heat pump consumption as a percentage of total usage tends to be higher, suggesting increased reliance on heat pumps during colder periods.

**Observations by Location**

Selected locations, such as tregattu 11 and daviksvagen 4, exhibit consistent energy usage patterns:

Some facilities have a consistently high heat pump share (over 60%), possibly indicating a heavier reliance on heat pump systems.

In contrast, other sites show relatively lower heat pump contributions (around 20–30%), which may be due to alternative heating systems or less active heat pump operation.

Variability between locations suggests that facility-specific characteristics (e.g., building size, existing infrastructure, local climate) significantly affect energy consumption patterns.

**Anomaly Detection**

Outliers in the dataset reveal potential data quality issues. A few facilities demonstrate extreme values in total energy consumption or heat pump contribution, warranting further investigation. Such anomalies could stem from sensor malfunctions or temporary operational changes.

## Suggestions for Further Analysis

* Granular Analysis:

Dive deeper into hourly consumption data using rolling averages and seasonality analysis to understand peak usage hours and better predict energy demand.

* Comparative Analysis:

Compare facilities with similar attributes (e.g., building size, location, facility type) to understand the influence of facility characteristics on energy efficiency and heat pump performance.

* Anomaly Investigation:

Identify and analyze outlier events to discern whether they reflect sensor issues or real operational anomalies.

## Proposed Improvements

1. Data Acquisition and Integration Pipelines

* Real-Time Data Ingestion:

Implement a robust data ingestion framework (e.g., using Apache Kafka or AWS Kinesis) to ensure real-time acquisition of both heat pump and total consumption data.

* Improved Data Integration:

Enhance the integration pipeline to reconcile differences in timestamp formats, time zones, and sensor calibration details. Leverage automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools to streamline data consolidation.

* Data Versioning:

Adopt data versioning and quality checks (using tools like DVC or Pachyderm) to maintain reproducibility and trace the origin of data anomalies.

2. Data Resolution and Consistency Checks

* Resolution Standardization:

Standardize time resolution across datasets (e.g., consistently using UTC timestamps and a uniform time interval) to improve the accuracy of time-based aggregations.

* Data Validation:

Integrate consistency checks (using custom validation scripts or frameworks like Great Expectations) to automatically flag missing or out-of-range data points.

* Duplication Handling:

Improve deduplication methods during data preprocessing to ensure each facility’s data is accurately represented without redundancy or data loss.

3. Visualization and Reporting for Stakeholders

* Interactive Dashboards:

Develop interactive dashboards (using tools like Streamlit, Tableau, or Power BI) to allow stakeholders to visualize trends, compare locations, and explore the data dynamically.

* Automated Reporting:

Set up scheduled, automated reporting (using Cron jobs or Airflow) to distribute periodic insights (daily, weekly, monthly) to decision makers.

* Enhanced Charts and Maps:

Utilize geospatial visualization to map energy consumption and heat pump contributions by facility location, providing a clearer contextual understanding.

4. Recommendations for Additional Sensors and Metadata

**Additional Sensor Data**:

Consider integrating additional sensors for granular data, such as:

* Indoor temperature sensors to correlate energy use with ambient temperature.

* Humidity sensors to factor in weather conditions.

* Occupancy sensors to relate energy patterns to facility usage.

**Metadata Enrichment**:

Collect metadata related to facility characteristics (e.g., building age, floor area, insulation levels) to improve model precision and enable deeper analysis.

**External Data Sources**:

Integrate external datasets, such as weather data or energy price information, to evaluate external influences on energy consumption patterns.

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals that heat pump contribution significantly varies by time of day, day, and month, with distinct patterns observed across different facility locations. Moving forward, refining our data ingestion and validation processes, along with enhanced visualization and additional sensor integration, will further improve our understanding of energy consumption patterns. These insights not only aid in optimizing energy usage but also provide actionable recommendations for facility improvements and future sensor deployments.
